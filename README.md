This program helps us to determine whether a text in a folder is spam or not and can be used for emails to verify whether they are spam mails or not.

- It is trained on the `emails.csv` file.
- It uses algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.
- Hyperparameter tuning is performed for better results.
- Refer to `Report.pdf` for getting information of the procedure followed in this implementation.
